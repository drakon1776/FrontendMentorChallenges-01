## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

It was the first time for me using SASS, so I tried with something relatively simple: I think I managed to learn using SASS nesting features.

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge of SASS and try to use its variables and tables to write faster and cleaner code.
